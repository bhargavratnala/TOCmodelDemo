# Automata Demonstration using Canvas

This project demonstrates the working of automata using **HTML5 Canvas** and **JavaScript**. It visualizes various automata concepts like **finite state machines (FSM)**, **pushdown automata (PDA)**, and others, providing an interactive platform for learning and experimentation.

## Features
- **Automata Simulation**: Visualizes different types of automata such as DFA, NFA, and PDA.
- **Interactive Canvas**: Allows users to observe automata states, transitions, and input processing in real time.
- **Customizable Automata**: Users can input their own automata definitions and see the results.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides a step-by-step visualization of how inputs are processed by the automata.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface designed for ease of use.

## Demo
You can view the live demo of the automata simulation [here](#).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the automata and transitions visually.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for simulating the automata and managing user interactions.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface.
- **Bootstrap (optional)**: If used, for responsive design and UI components.

## Automata Supported
- **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)**: Visualizes deterministic states and transitions.
- **Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**: Handles multiple possible states for a given input.
- **Pushdown Automata (PDA)**: Simulates stack-based automata with visual stack operations.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a modern browser that supports **HTML5 Canvas** and **JavaScript**.

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/automata-simulator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd automata-simulator
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser to start the simulation.

### Running on a Local Server
If you'd like to run it on a local server (e.g., for development), you can use tools like **Live Server**.

1. Install Live Server globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g live-server
    ```

2. Run Live Server in the project folder:
    ```bash
    live-server
    ```

3. Open your browser and visit:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```
